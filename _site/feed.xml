        <title>Race Day - Berea Splash and Dash</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There will be &lt;strong&gt;NO RACE DAY REGISTRATION for Daniel Boone Splash and Dash&lt;/strong&gt;. On-line registration closes on &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, June 15, 2016, at midnight&lt;/strong&gt;. We will take in-person registrations on Thursday - Tuesday (June 16-21) at City of Berea Pool packet pick-up until the race is sold out. There is a late fee ($5 added per child) for registrations after on-line closes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children must be accompanied by their parent at packet pick-up.&lt;/strong&gt;
You will be required to purchase an annual youth membership ($10) to USA Triathlon. You can purchase it by registering for this race. Or you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.usatriathlon.org/&quot;&gt;purchase an annual youth membership&lt;/a&gt;. There are no refunds if weather cancels all or part of the race. A canceled race will not be rescheduled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;race-morning&quot;&gt;Race Morning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After parking, parents should escort their child with all their Aquathlon gear to the City of Berea Pool. Signs will direct you. You must check in with our race volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;body-marking&quot;&gt;Body Marking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After checking in race morning, your child should go to the body marking area (signs will direct you). Your child’s race number (found in race packet) will be marked on his/her leg and arm. These markings will be used to identify your child at the start of the swim. Your child will also have a timing chip attached to their left ankle. This is not removed until they cross the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pre-race-meeting&quot;&gt;Pre-Race Meeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;There is a MANDATORY pre-race meeting for all athletes at **8:15 AM** in the transition area.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;race-start&quot;&gt;Race Start&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be starting the Splash and Dash by age groups beginning with the youngest, &lt;strong&gt;7yr-8yr, at 8:30 AM&lt;/strong&gt;. Athletes will be called waves - by their age group - from the staging area to the swim start 15- minutes prior to their start time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Wave&lt;/strong&gt; - 8:30 AM 7-9 age group (GOLD)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Wave&lt;/strong&gt; - 10-11 age group (BLUE)
  Will start when the previous wave have departed the swim and headed to the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Wave&lt;/strong&gt; - 12-13 age group (RED)
  Will start when the previous wave have departed the swim  and headed to the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth Wave&lt;/strong&gt; - 14-15 age group (GREEN)
  Will start when the previous wave have departed the swim and headed to the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-a-transition-area&quot;&gt;What’s a Transition Area?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sport of Aquathlon, the Transition Area is like the hub in the center of a wheel with the swim and run like wheel spokes. The athlete passes through the Transition Area once in the event. In the Transition Area, the athlete moves from swimming to running. The transition area for Splash and Dash located below the pool in the rear parking lot, and is designated by signs, and brightly colored fencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-happened-in-the-transition-area&quot;&gt;What happened in the Transition Area?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;before-the-race&quot;&gt;Before the race:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual spots will be assigned and numbered. Each athlete will be in an area designated for their age group. This is where the athlete removes any swim gear (goggles, swim cap) quickly with a towel to dry off, and obtains shoes/socks, shirt, shorts, and other needed gear needed on the run. Athletes should have their equipment set up at least 30- minutes before the 8:30 AM start time. To make sure everyone has room in the transition area, each athlete should use only the minimum amount of space required to place their gear. Parents are allowed in the transition area to help their child until 8:30 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;during-the-race&quot;&gt;During the race:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 8:30 AM until the final athlete is on the run course no parents or guardians are permitted in the Transition Area, except for those with special needs. If you have special needs please designate that during check-in. Volunteers will be present to assist the athletes and to restrict access. This restriction is to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all of the athletes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;after-the-race&quot;&gt;After the race:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the race, athletes will not be allowed back into the transition area until the final competitor is out on the run course. Volunteers will be present in the transition area. To remove the gear from the Transition Area you may be asked to show a race number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tips-for-the-transition-area&quot;&gt;Tips for the Transition Area&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get to the race venue early so that you can set up your young athlete’s Transition Area location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete your Transition Area setup by 8:15 AM. There will be a MANDATORY pre-race meeting at 8:15 AM., after which the 7-9-year-old age group will be lined up in the pool area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring 2 towels, one of which should be old. Put the old towel on the ground at your child’s location and place his/her race running stuff on it. The other towel is for drying after the swim.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is recommended that you have a full water bottle there so your athlete can grab a quick drink before exiting the Transition Area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The time spent in the Transition Area counts towards the overall time so it should be as fast as is reasonable, but not so fast that your athlete forgets to tie his/her shoes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Volunteers will be present in the Transition Area to assist athletes during the race so we ask that parents please stay out for the safety of the participants.
The Splash and Dash is sanctioned by (insert USAT LOGO here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>F.A.Q. - Berea Splash and Dash</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-youth-aquathlon&quot;&gt;What is a Youth Aquathlon?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Aquathlon is a smaller version of a Triathlon, one of the fastest-growing sports in the world. The youth Aquathlon is an entry event for youth and communities to experience and experiment with this trend. There is no better way for a child to experience the benefits of a healthy lifestyle focused on daily exercise and good nutrition. Every Aquathlon consists of 3 components – swimming, running, and transition. At the Daniel Boone Splash and Dash youth athletes will only race against other children in their same age group. We will utilize a time trial start in The City of Berea City Pool, 8-lane pool meaning each racer will enter the pool one at a time. As they complete their swim, they will get out of the pool, and jog down to the transition area to begin the run portion of the race. The run is the final portion of the race. Computerized timing chips are used to track each participant throughout each part of the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-participate&quot;&gt;Why participate?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event exposes and educates youth to the healthy, multisport, active lifestyle, all while being involved in a fun, exciting, and safe atmosphere! It will really help you to “get your feet wet!”
The event engages Central Kentucky youth athletes to activities that expand their recreational activities and add value to their educational opportunities.
The event creates an opportunity to meet friends and other youth athletes who are interested and also engage in the multisport lifestyle!
The event requires less equipment required compared to that of a triathlon since a Splash and Dash (An Aquathlon) does not require a bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-gear-do-i-need-for-the-aquathlon&quot;&gt;What gear do I need for the Aquathlon?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wear your swimsuit, and if you want, you can wear goggles. You are required to wear your Daniel Boone Splash and Dash swim cap during the swim. You will need a bright towel, running shoes, socks, and some running shorts if you don’t want to run in your swim suit. A visor or cap is optional for the run. So are sunglasses.  You can bring a water bottle with water or your favorite training liquid.
At packet pick-up, you will receive your race shirt that you wear on the run course. You will also get a number that should be pinned on the front of your race shirt. Don’t forget to bring both to the race! Your parents may want to pack a change of clothes for you after the race, but that is optional too. Athletes in the 13-14-year-old group can wear their tri suit on the swim and run. They will need to wear their race number either on a race belt or race shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-the-actual-race-distances&quot;&gt;What are the actual race distances?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7-10 years old – 100-meter swim, 1-kilometer run course&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11-15 years old - 200-meter swim, 2 –kilometer run course&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-old-do-i-have-to-be&quot;&gt;How old do I have to be?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minimum RACE AGE (the child’s age as of 12/31/15) is 6- years old. On the other end of the spectrum, anyone turning 15 before December 31/2017, will not be allowed to race. Age guidelines are established by USA Triathlon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;can-i-really-complete-an-aquathlon&quot;&gt;Can I really complete an Aquathlon?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race distances are set by USA Triathlon and designed to be challenging, yet achievable – even for first-timers. The word triathlon can scare people into thinking it is something they could never do. Plain and simple, if your child can swim a few or more laps in a pool, and ride their bike for 20 minutes without stopping, they can successfully complete a kid’s triathlon. If they cannot do this now, there still may be time to set some goals and to get ready to race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-is-putting-on-the-race&quot;&gt;Who is putting on the race?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Daniel Boone Splash and Dash is the idea of the EPG Program and the City of Berea Trail Town Committee. These two groups had members that are experienced triathletes and see the value of living a healthy lifestyle. Through the combined efforts of the City of Berea Trail Town Committee, the special event team has recruited some of the most knowledgeable triathletes and race veterans in the area to make this a fun, safe, and exciting event for the kids. This includes Sam Dick, race Director of The Lexington Kid’s Legacy Tri, a sanctioned USA Triathlon race, which will be the training site for special event Splash and Dash team. That means USA Triathlon has reviewed the Splash and Dash course layout, emergency precautions, and safety to make this sanctioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Daniel Boone Splash and Dash team is currently executing a Signature and Lead Sponsor fundraising program for the event. The Splash and Dash team is also executing a community fundraising model to secure youth sponsorship so that all youth can gain entry in the event. The idea for the youth scholarship sponsorships emerged from blending of the ethics and values taught to Berea College EPG Program students and the grant awarded by the ownership of the Holiday Inn Express in recognition for the contributions made by EPG students to the formation and certification of the City of Berea Trails and the State of Kentucky Trail Town. The Splash and Dash is intended to demonstrate to the Berea community, to the small business establishments and the Berea Tourism Commission that there are latent community assets of value to out-of-towners that can be showcased to encourage out-of-towners to come and engage in the  Berea community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-can-i-pick-up-my-race-number-and-packet&quot;&gt;When can I pick up my race number and packet?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All participants should come to the City of Berea Pool on June 14 or June 22 at 6:00pm in Berea at the City of Berea Pool. These are the only scheduled times for packet and race number pick-up, though we will try to accommodate special exceptions from out-of-county families. There will NOT be any packet pick-up or registration on Race Day unless approved by Race Director. There are no refunds if weather cancels all or part of the race. A canceled race will not be rescheduled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-should-i-eat-the-night-before-the-race&quot;&gt;What should I eat the night before the race?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While every person is different, most experts do NOT suggest a heavy meal the morning of a race. Every racer will need a lot of energy, so a traditional pasta dinner or another meal with lots of carbohydrates and protein is quite common the day before racing. Of course, you know your body and normal eating habits better than anyone. It is always safe to follow those. The only thing almost everyone agrees on . . . it is NOT a good time to try a new food for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-should-i-eat-for-breakfast-on-race-day&quot;&gt;What should I eat for breakfast on race day?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, it is best to listen to your body and to do what feels right. It also depends on what time you get up and what time you are racing. Greasy, heavy food and milk are generally recipes for upset stomachs. A banana, orange, apple, bagel with peanut butter, or grapefruit are all reasonable, but again, it’s different for each child. One thing you do NOT want to do is skip breakfast on Race Day. You will need all the energy you can get to complete the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-should-i-show-up-for-the-race&quot;&gt;When should I show up for the race?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early! The parking will open at 7:00 AM on race day. Your parents will be asked to park in the Community School parking lot, and then racers check-in at the Pool area. After checking in, you will be body marked with your race number and age. Next, you can set up in your transition area. Parents and other non-racers are not allowed in the transition area after 8:30 AM. There will be trained volunteers available to help the youth if needed. There will be a MANDATORY pre-race meeting of all athletes in the transition at 8:15 AM.  The first swimmers will start at 8:30 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-there-be-prizes&quot;&gt;Will there be prizes?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every youth participant will receive a finisher’s medal when they cross the finish line&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-there-be-traffic-on-the-route&quot;&gt;Will there be traffic on the route?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the entire race will be held within the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-there-be-aid-stations-on-the-course&quot;&gt;Will there be aid stations on the course?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes – there will be one aid station on the run and food at the finish line. We encourage athletes to bring a water bottle to keep in transition for after the swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-will-be-offered-at-the-aid-stations&quot;&gt;What will be offered at the aid stations?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water and Gatorade. There will be fruit, cookies and drinks at the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-event&quot;&gt;What happens at the end of the event?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be free food and drinks for participants. There will be photos. There is an awards ceremony following the race.  We encourage all athletes and spectators to stay around for the awards ceremony!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Course Info - Berea Splash and Dash</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How long is the race?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Swim&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Run&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7-9&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;100 meters&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1 K&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10-11&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;100 meters&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1 K&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;12-15&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;200 meters&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2 K&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;swim-course&quot;&gt;Swim Course&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swim is in the 8-lane, heated, outdoor 25-meter pool at The City of Berea Pool. Lifeguards will be poolside along with a doctor. Each child will start their race in the water, no diving or jumping is allowed. Athletes will swim the length of the pool, touch the wall (flip turns are allowed), go underneath the lane rope, and swim back in the new lane. On exit of the water there will be a short run on concrete down to the transition “IN”, and shoes are permitted for this run. A special needs table will be set-up at the pool gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each age group will have a colored swim cap for quick identification. The Splash and Dash swim caps are required to be worn during the swim. Goggles are permitted, but no other swim aides are allowed. Swimmers can use any style stroke in the pool. They are allowed to hang on to the side or lane ropes to rest, but can’t move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run-course&quot;&gt;Run Course&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Run Course is an out and back run on closed, City of Berea multi-use trail for all age groups.
After athletes have gathered their running gear, they begin the run, and will exit the transition area at “RUN OUT,” and begin the last leg of the Aquathlon. A water station will be located at the gate leading to the run course, and a second water station will be on the course. At the end of the run, the athletes will come down the finish line chute to the roars of the crowd, great music, and each will receive a race medal and have their picture taken for those who swim and run for sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
