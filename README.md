# Instructions for Editing Splash and Dash 

Use Github to make changes to the site.
Changes you make are made live at [bereatrails.github.io/Splash-and-Dash](http://bereatrails.github.io/Splash-and-Dash)

Editing Detailed Pages requires Markdown:

Markdown is a neat way to write the content of websites in a way that is human readable. Blogs, forums, and Q&A boards use it often. It's a useful skill to learn.

#### You are able to edit 2 main components of the site:

1. Landing Page
2. Detailed Pages (About, Rules, etc.)

## Landing Page

From the "<> Code" tab above, enter the "_data" folder and open "info.yml". Click the "edit" button at the top of the window.

Click "Commit Changes" at the bottom to save and publish to the test site.

When satisfied with changes, inform Robert and he will push updates to the live site.

The "info.yml" file has instructions to help you edit the landing page.

#### Key Points:

- key: value is the format of the file
- Do **NOT** change keys, only change values
- You may make multiple "- paragraph:" values
- Alignment matters! Make sure all "- paragraph:" keys are indented so they line up.
- Each section can have 2 buttons. 
- You can add the text that is displayed on the button and the url where the button goes to.
- To delete a button just leave its value blank.

## Detailed Pages

Click the "<> Code" tab and navigate to the "_posts" folder. 

The "_posts" folder contains files named "2016-04-01-ABOUT.md" and others. The "ABOUT" in the title means that this page is the about page.

This is where you use Markdown.

Click "Commit Changes" at the bottom to save and publish to the test site.

When satisfied with changes, inform Robert and he will push updates to the live site.


### Key Points:

- Do **NOT** edit anything between the two rows of "- - -" at the top of these files. This signals information to the site that is not seen by the user.

- Use Markdown to create new content or edit existing content
